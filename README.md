# chili-gcc-8.4

Experimental gcc re-port to the OnDemand (RIP) VLIW Chili architecture. Yeah, it
is 2020 and we have to counter COVID-19 somehow.

Merely intended to be educational for those into embedded compiler development.
The target architecture plays no role in the embedded world (it actually never
did), and despite of all its flaws and shortcomings, it might be interesting
(again, for educational purposes) for porting since featuring a comparably
simple core ISA.

Unfortunately, there is no way to target the hardware, the only way to test the
code is the old ISS, i am possibly going to port later.

There is only a very rudimentary documentation that does not cover every detail,
thus, things that are unclear are free to be interpreted in a most pleasing way.

NOTE, while the original company is long gone and only a bunch of folks know what
what Chili is/was, if you happen to be one of the IP owners, please let me know,
until then, let the architecture serve the public in good will.
